# intent: As a DSL, RSpec perhaps shouldn't be held to this metric at all, but moreover,
# although the largeness of test files does reduce their readability, to flesh out overall behavior it's helpful to
# have a few large tests that demonstrate the relevant cases for the problem domain at a higher level than
# the individual components.  game_parser_spec does this as-is for now, and the reference implementation's tests
# are similarly at an acceptance-like level.
